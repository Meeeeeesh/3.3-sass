            I want to grow old with you because all of the weird stuff we do now will be super cute when we're older, and everyone will be like, "Awww... look at those old people chasing ducks and throwing bread at each other. That is super cute."

            If I had a time machine, I would go back to the Cretaceous period, domesticate your favorite dinosaur, bring it back to the future, use their science to miniaturize him, then go back to present day and give it to you as a pet.

            I honestly think you can do anything you put your mind to. But I know what kind of thoughts you have, so maybe hold off on that for now.

            You're the best kind of friend, because when I look like crap, you don't pretend like I don't. You're just like, "Whoa! What happened to you?!" Which can be nice because sometimes I need to tell you what happened.
